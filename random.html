                    <p>I believe opportunity, means, and training can bring out greatness in anyone. Most people wonâ€™t agree. I enjoy watching the NFL with pizza, I feel personally offended when the wifi cuts out on me, and sometimes I dream about writing a $1M check for the Detroit public schools.</p>
                    <p>I value education, health, talking to the people I care about in person, and being challenged when I work. I built this website because I believe that if you want someone to join your organization for the foreseeable future, you should be able to know who they are as a person.</p>
